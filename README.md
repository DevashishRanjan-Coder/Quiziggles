# Quiziggles

I have made this project as an assignment under Dr. Angela Yu's web dev bootcamp.
The assignment was to make something using any public API.
So i decided to make a quiz game using two public APIs. I have used Node.js as my runtime environment, EJS as my templating engine, Express.JS for running the server, CSS for styling and Javascript for backend.

The app is hosted on render - https://quiziggles.onrender.com/ 
(This is a free instance so according to render there will be a 50 sec delay)
